Old Way: user clicks link, browser sends request to remote server
React Router: purpose is to circumvent above process
Instead the router intercepts URL changes and just displays
different components based on the new URL

'History' package part of react-router
User clicks link > calls History lib > History parses new
URL and passes it to react-router > router decides to show 
updated components.
We write the code that says "Hey, Router, if the URL says X, 
show this. If Y, show this. > Router delegates to React
to render the new components

This is the basis of an SPA (single page app).
